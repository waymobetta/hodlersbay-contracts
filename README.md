## Hodlers' Bay

Yaaaaarrrrr! So ye've heard of Hodlers' Bay, have ye? Locals have grown accustomed to calling it the 'Bay'. But you are not a local, are ye?

This be not an ordinary Bay. This be the bay where the hodler always wins. 

Enough of this pirate heebob, what am I getting myself into and how can I make money with Hodlers' Bay?
- to be a peer in Hodlers' Bay, one must stake _store_ at least _votable param_ Ether with a certain timelock on the funds
- being a peer allows you to be entitled to a piece of the early withdrawl tax (more commonly referred to as _Loot_) when someone pulls their Ether out early
- this encourages hodling and discourages panic selling


### *Walk The Plank*
When an account decides to withdraw all of their funds from Hodlers Bay they will be forced to walk the plank, and will be robbed of all the loot they've acquired at Hodlers' Bay. The loot stolen will then be dispersed to all remaining hodlers in the bay as stated below.

### *Black Spot*
When an account is forced to _Walk The Plank_, there will be a permanent black spot put on that account which will prevent it from every performing another transaction in Hodlers' Bay.

### *"No Prey, No Pay"*
A common pirate law meaning a crew received no wages, but rather shared whatever loot was taken. The only time a "Yo, ho ho!" is warrented is when loot is being redistributed after the Hodlers' Bay rids itself of a less-than-worthy soul.
