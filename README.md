## Hodlers' Bay

Yaaaaarrrrr! So ye've heard of Hodlers' Bay, have ye? Locals take a likening to calling it the 'Bay'. But you are not a local, are ye?

This be not an ordinary Bay. This be the bay where the hodler always wins.

Enough of this pirate , what am I getting myself into and how can I make money with Hodlers' Bay?
- to be a peer in hodler's bay, one must stake _store_ at least _votable param_ ether
- being a peer allows you to be entitled to a piece of the early withdrawl tax when someone pulls their money out
- thus, the hodler is always incentived to hodl
- this encourages hodling and discourages panic selling
